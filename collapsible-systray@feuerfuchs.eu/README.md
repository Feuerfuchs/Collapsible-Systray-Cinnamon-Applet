This applet is a replacement for the popular but, sadly, abandonded [System Tray Collapsible](cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/154) Cinnamon applet. As such, this applet's main purpose is to integrate tray icons seamlessly into your desktop (by styling them as applets) and allowing you to hide icons you rarely need.


# Installation

To install the applet, execute the `install.sh` script. If the applet doesn't appear in the applet list, you should restart Cinnamon by pressing Alt+F2, typing 'r' (without ') and hitting enter.
To remove the applet, just run `install.sh -r`.
